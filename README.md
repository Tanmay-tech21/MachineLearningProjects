# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects I've worked on, covering a variety of topics and techniques.

**Contents:**

* **Recommender Systems:**
    * **Collaborative Filtering:** Implementations of user-based and item-based collaborative filtering algorithms. 
    * **Content-Based Filtering:** Algorithms that recommend items based on their similarity to items previously enjoyed by the user.
    * **Hybrid Approaches:** Combinations of collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendations.

* **Decision Trees & Random Forests:**
    * **Decision Tree Classification:** Implementations of ID3, C4.5, and CART algorithms.
    * **Random Forest Classification:** Ensemble learning using multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
    * **Applications:** Examples of using decision trees for classification tasks such as spam detection, customer churn prediction, and image recognition.

* **K-Means Clustering:**
    * **Implementation:** Implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm.
    * **Applications:** Examples of using k-means for customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection.

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
    * **Implementation:** Implementations of KNN for classification and regression tasks.
    * **Distance Metrics:** Exploration of different distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.) and their impact on KNN performance.
    * **Applications:** Examples of using KNN for image classification, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection.

* **Linear Regression:**
    * **Simple Linear Regression:** Implementation of simple linear regression with gradient descent.
    * **Multiple Linear Regression:** Implementation of multiple linear regression with feature scaling and regularization techniques.
    * **Applications:** Examples of using linear regression for predicting stock prices, housing prices, and sales forecasts.

* **Logistic Regression:**
    * **Implementation:** Implementation of logistic regression with gradient descent and regularization techniques.
    * **Applications:** Examples of using logistic regression for binary classification tasks such as spam detection, customer churn prediction, and fraud detection.

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
    * **Text Classification:** Implementations of text classification models using techniques like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and deep learning.
    * **Sentiment Analysis:** Models for analyzing sentiment in text data (e.g., movie reviews, social media posts).
    * **Topic Modeling:** Techniques for discovering hidden topics within a collection of documents (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation).

* **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**
    * **Implementation:** Implementations of SVM for both classification and regression tasks.
    * **Kernel Methods:** Exploration of different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, RBF) and their impact on SVM performance.
    * **Applications:** Examples of using SVM for image classification, text classification, and object detection.

**Technologies:**

* **Programming Languages:** Python (primarily)
* **Libraries:** 
    * scikit-learn
    * TensorFlow/PyTorch (for deep learning)
    * Pandas
    * NumPy
    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn
